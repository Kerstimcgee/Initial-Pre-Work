//create a string using a multiple variables. Here we learn to merge our
//name with a couple of sayings

// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Kersti";
var myStr = "Hello, my name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
